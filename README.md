The story goes that, in the past, people didn't know about bacteria, germs or viruses. People illness was caused by 'bad air' or evil spirits. But in the 1800s Doctors started looking more at anatomy, doing autopsies and making arguments based on data. 

Dr Semmelweis suspected that something was going wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital. Dr Semmelweis wanted to figure out why so many woman in maternity wards were dying from childbed fever.

This project analyse a dataset on the past winners of the Nobel Prize. Let's see what patterns we can uncover in the past Nobel laureates and what can we learn about the Nobel prize and our world more generally

A bit of history, 

On November 27, 1895, Alfred Nobel signed his last will in Paris. When it was opened after his death, the will caused a lot of controversy, as Nobel had left much of his wealth for the establishment of a prize. 

Alfred Nobel dictates that his entire remaining estate should be used to endow "prizes to those who, during the preceding year, have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind".

Every year the Nobel Prize is given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics and peace.
